            <h2>The Prophet</h2>
            <p>A Prophet sat in the market-place and told the fortunes of all who cared to engage his services. Suddenly there came running up one who told him that his house had been broken into by thieves, and that they had made off with everything they could lay hands on. He was up in a moment, and rushed off, tearing his hair and calling down curses on the miscreants. The bystanders were much amused, and one of them said, &ldquo;&#8201;Our friend professes to know what is going to happen to others, but it seems he&rsquo;s not clever enough to perceive what&rsquo;s in store for himself.&rdquo;</p>
