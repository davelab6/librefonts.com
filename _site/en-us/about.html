<h1 id="welcome">Welcome</h1>

<p>Learning FontForge is easy – get started designing your own fonts with the <a href="/en-US/tutorials/">tutorial</a>. The entire <a href="/en-US/documentation/interface/">interface</a> is fully documented.</p>

<p>Scripting allows designers to get repetitive tasks done quickly, and FontForge has excellent <a href="/en-US/documentation/scripting/">scripting support</a> with both its own scripting language and <a href="/en-US/documentation/scripting/python/">Python</a>.</p>

<p>FontForge can be <a href="/en-US/documentation/customizing/">customized</a> so it feels familiar, from hotkeys to visual themes and a translatable interface.</p>

<p>You can share copies of FontForge freely and make changes under a <a href="/en-US/about/project/license/">libre license</a>. You are invited to participate in this project; your bug reports, feature suggestions, tutorial ideas and code contributions are all welcome! <a href="/en-US/documentation/developers/">Learn more…</a></p>
